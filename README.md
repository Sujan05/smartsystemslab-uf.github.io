# Welcome

We are very pleased that you found the way to our website and hope to provide you with all the information you are seeking on our activities.


Our main research field is the design of smart embedded systems, with emphasis of run-time optimization. We investigate the design and run-time operation of high-performance and adaptive architectures with application in image processing, embedded optimization, security, and control.


Besides regular computer engineering classes such as Operating Systems, Computer Architectures, Computer Organization and Design, and Embedded Systems, our graduate classes reflect one or more aspect of our research.


For students, we offer the possibility to be involved early in research and development of the most innovative ideas and technologies. Under our research section we provide topics for Bachelor and Master Thesis, independent research subjects, and undergraduate projects that will help students acquire sufficient practical and theoretical knowledge in computer engineering. We are also open to new ideas from students.


If you are a company that needs a feasibility study, need a prototype development, or is willing to contract a research topic, we will be glad to discuss in detail with you. Feel free to contact us anytime for further information.
