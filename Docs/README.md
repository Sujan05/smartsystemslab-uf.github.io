# Documentation

This page is meant help everyone understand GitHub and the setup of our new lab website.

- The first requirement is a GitHub account and either a command line interface or desktop client, like the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com), for accessing the git repository for the website. Please send Taylor, tjlwhitaker@gmail.com, an email containing your GitHub username so that you can be added as a contributor.

- Once you are added to the repo, you will be able to clone the repository to your own computer so that you can start to make and edit your own project pages.

There are a number directories in the website folder that is downloaded. These are the important ones.

This website is automatically generated for us, we just have to provide the text and a little bit of text styling. These folders hold the content of the webpages that we will see. All pages are built with the markdown language and will be in a README.md file. This page is an example of such. The source can be seen at [https://github.com/smartsystemslab-uf/smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/blob/master/Docs/README.md](https://github.com/smartsystemslab-uf/smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/blob/master/Docs/README.md). The actual webpage that is produced can be seen at [https://smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/Docs/](https://smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/Docs/). The URL of the webpage closely matches the directory path to the README.md file.
