# Documentation

This page is meant help everyone understand GitHub and the setup of our new lab website.

- The first requirement is a GitHub account for accessing the git repository for the website. Please send Taylor Whitaker an email containing your GitHub username so that you can be added as a contributor.



- Once you are added to the repo, you will be able to write to the repo located at: https://github.com/smartsystemslab-uf/smartsystemslab-uf.github.io

clone the repository to your own computer so that you can start to make and edit your own project pages.
 and either a command line interface or desktop client, like the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com),  

There are a number directories in the website folder that is downloaded. These are the important ones.

This website is automatically generated for us, we just have to provide the text and a little bit of text styling. These folders hold the content of the webpages that we will see. All pages are built with the markdown language and will be in a README.md file. This page is an example of such. The source can be found in the docs folder [HERE](https://github.com/smartsystemslab-uf/smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/blob/master/Docs/). The actual webpage that is produced can be seen at [https://smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/Docs/](https://smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/Docs/). The URL of the webpage closely matches the directory path to the README.md file.


### Docs

This folder holds this README.md file and two folders, Template and MarkdownConventions.

The Template folder holds the template that should be used for your README.md files. [Source File](https://github.com/smartsystemslab-uf/smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/blob/master/Docs/Template/README.md) - [Generated Webpage](https://smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/Docs/Template/)

The MarkdownConventions folder holds a few examples of what styling you can use in a README.md file. [Source File](https://github.com/smartsystemslab-uf/smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/blob/master/Docs/MarkdownConventions/README.md) - [Generated Webpage](https://smartsystemslab-uf.github.io/Docs/MarkdownConventions/)


### Projects

This folder holds all the project pages. Every project needs its own directory that will contain a README.md file for the content and an images folder for any images used. Take a look at some of the existing project folders and the resulting pages.
