## Projects

I am currently a graduate student studying computer engineering though I still thoroughly enjoy almost every aspect of computing systems. To satisfy my broad interests, FPGAs have been central in all my undertakings and have allowed me to research high level software frameworks like, ROS and ArduPilot, running on custom Linux kernels as well as develop custom hardware and associating firmware for these systems.

This page is an attempt to collect some of the work I have taken part in and be a
better member of the open-source community.
