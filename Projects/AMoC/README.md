# AMoC - Adaptive Multiprocessor on-Chip



## Description
The AMoC project (Adaptive Multiprocessors-on-Chip) is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeintschaft (German Research Foundation) and focusses on the design of adaptive reconfigurable chip multiprocessor systems. Therefore, a design methodology for FPGA-based (Field- Programmable Gate Array) multiprocessorsystems on chip was developed and can be seen in the following figure:

	Design Flow
</p>
The architectural synthesis flow starts with a MPI parallel program and ends with a bit-stream used for the configuration of an FPGA. In this case, the communication in the parallel program need to be described with MPI (Message Passing Interface). The application is then simulated and analyzed to obtain information about task precedence and inter-task data traffic. This information is used to specify an instance of an Integer Linear Program (ILP) problem [1, 2, 3]. Additionally, information on processing elements and communication networks, especially their costs and constraints, for a target platform is needed. That is, in the case of Xilinx FPGAs for instance the actual size of the FPGA, costs for the available processing elements, like MicroBlaze soft-core processor or PowerPC hard-core processor or the bandwidth and latency of communication networks. In this approach, the design-space of the ILP problem is not pre-constrained, and the problem dimensions are not ranked. This insures the optimality of found solutions. However, for system requirements, such as real-time requirements, it is sufficient to meet certain timing constraints, so that the interest is not to find the overall fastest solution, but the smallest instead. The solution to the ILP instance is then used to generate an description of the system, which is passed to the tool-chains to generate the configuration bit-stream. Because post-synthesis results could deviate from initial cost models used, new cost models can optionally be extracted after placement and routing to start a new iteration. SoC-MPI [4], a lightweight and flexible communication library, is used for the software-sided communication of the MPI program after the architecture is determined. However, the SoC-MPI library allows hardware-supported MPI functions and currently covers a subset of the MPI-I specification. This methodology is integrated in the PinHaT (Program-independent Hardware Generation Tool) [5, 6], which addionally allows other design entries, like the specification and refinement of the architecture by hand. PinHaT currently supports Xilinx FPGAs and to some degree Altera FPGAs.
The architecural synthesis flow is currently extended with a semi-automatic parallelization procedure, which allows the user to take a sequential program and parallelize it, as far as the structure of the program allows. The first work in this field is the parallelization of functions and the inserttion of MPI commands [7] to perform communiction. This straight-forward approach will be extended with the parallelization on block-level, especially the parallelization of loops, which in most cases have a high degree of code which can be executed in parallel. On goal of this parallelization procedure is to conserve the original code and not use an intermediate reprersentaion (three adress code). The flow begins then with the parallelization and insertion of MPI commands and ends with the the configuration bit-stream for the FPGA.
